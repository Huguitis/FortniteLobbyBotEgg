## Procedure until first boot
[PC](pc.md "pc.md")  
・Since it'll boot using resources on PC, limitation and performance degradation are less  
・But you can only boot bot while PC is running  

## Procedure to setup
**I'll explain with the premise that you finished procedure above and opened web page**  
May you can see config editor, put bot account's email address etc  
Documentations of each settings are [here](config.md "config.md")  

If configuring has done, press Save button on bottom right and bot will reboot  
After reboot check log and follow to log  
(We call this authorization)

After authorization, bot should boot  

**This is initialization so you don't have to do these many time**  
To run bot, if you are on PC run through folder which you saved
